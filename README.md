# 100Devs ADHD Group Project
## Project Overview
### Goal: 

This project is made by and for members of the 100Devs ADHD study group. Through this project we aim to fill the gap between people with the disability and the resources they need to excel in life. This includes providing support and aid to those who need it and optimizing our ability to learn and coordinate. The need for such a platform has been made evident by the struggles that our community experiences on a daily basis, and it is our hope that this website application helps members overcome those obstacles.

### Project Scope: (Subject to change by consensus)

* Sign-up, login and user account management.

* A help ticket system that allows the study group to easily visualize and track those who need help and those willing to provide help.

* A class tracking system that clearly lays out previous classes, dates, vods, slides and other relevant class materials. Each class will have a separate completion data point for each unique user. The completion data point will be able to be shared in the help ticket system.

* A homework tracking system that clearly lays out each assignment, date assigned, date due, related links and other related resources. Each assignment will have a separate completion data point for each unique user. That data point will be able to be shared in the help ticket system.

* A resource board that allows the team to categorize, describe, tag and share links. This data will be able to be shared with all other systems.

1. **Introductions** | *~5 minutes*

    * Ice Breaker Question.
    * Introductions.
    * Select minute taker.

2. **Review Project Scope & Guidelines (Quick Review)** | *~10 minutes* 
3. **Core Project (Quick Review)** | *~15 minutes*
4. **Brief Q&A** | *~15 minutes*
5. **Dividing up into teams** | *~15 minutes*

    Last week, everyone present chose a team. This is completely voluntary but is discussed collectively. Everyone is allowed to wear multiple hats.
    
    Teams operate in an egalitarian format, but there is a project management team to maintain optimal communication and workflow. We will rotate one person in each team every week to work with the project management team so that everyone can list the experience on their resume. This is completely voluntary.

    * Accessibility Team - Ensures ADA mandates are met and facilitates accessibility

    * Assign Front-end Team - (copy, css, design, html, typography)

    * Assign Full-stack Team - (helps with front and backend as needed)

    * Assign Back-end Team - (data structures, js, mongodb, node.js)

    * Assign Project-Management Team - (coordinates between teams, facilitates meetings and tracks progress)

5. **Break** | *~10 minutes*

7. **Discussion about UX & data structures for each system.** | *~45 minutes*

    During this portion of the meeting, if there are ideas brought up that don’t match the current scope of the project, we’ll park it in the parking lot (we’ll explain).

    At least 15 minutes needs to be dedicated to the front page because it will set the tone for the entire project and link all of the different systems together. We will discuss what progress has been made with the front page and coordinate what needs to be done for the week. 

    If there is more time, we'll move on to new pages that need to be structured.

8. **Summary & Wrap up** | *~5 minutes*
