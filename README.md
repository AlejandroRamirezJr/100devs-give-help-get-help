# 100Devs ADHD Group Project
## Project Overview
### Goal: 

This project is made by and for members of the 100Devs ADHD study group. Through this project we aim to fill the gap between people with the disability and the resources they need to excel in life. This includes providing support and aid to those who need it and optimizing our ability to learn and coordinate. The need for such a platform has been made evident by the struggles that our community experiences on a daily basis, and it is our hope that this website application helps members overcome those obstacles.

### Project Scope: (Subject to change by consensus)

* A sign-up and login system.

* A help ticket system that allows the study group to easily visualize and track those who need help and those willing to provide help.

* A class tracking system that clearly lays out previous classes, dates, vods, slides and other relevant class materials. Each class will have a separate completion data point for each unique user. The completion data point will be able to be shared in the help ticket system.

* A homework tracking system that clearly lays out each assignment, date assigned, date due, related links and other related resources. Each assignment will have a separate completion data point for each unique user. That data point will be able to be shared in the help ticket system.

* A resource board that allows the team to categorize, describe and share links. This data will be able to be shared with all other systems.

2. **Review Project Scope & Guidelines**| *~15 minutes* 
3. **Core Project Presentation** | *~20 minutes*

6. **Dividing up into teams** | *~15 minutes*

     This is completely voluntary but will be discussed collectively. Everyone is allowed to wear multiple hats. Teams will operate in an egalitarian format, but there will be a project management team to maintain optimal communication and workflow.

    * Assign Front-end Team

    * Assign Full-stack Team

    * Assign Back-end Team

    * Assign Project-Management Team

7. **Discussion about UX & data structures for each system.** | *~45 minutes*

    During this portion of the meeting, if there are ideas brought up that don’t match the current scope of the project, we’ll park it in the parking lot (we’ll explain). Whatever we don’t get to in 55 minutes, we’ll pick up during the next meeting.
    
    At least 15 minutes needs to be dedicated to the front page because it will set the tone for the entire project and link all of the different systems together. The front page is where we’ll all start to get our feet wet.


8. **Summary & Wrap up** | *~5 minutes*
