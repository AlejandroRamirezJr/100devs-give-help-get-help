# 100devs-give-help-get-help

## What are we doing?

**Goal:** We're trying to make our lives more manageable as a study group with adhd by making a web-app together. The goal is to allow the study group to optimize their ability to coordinate and keep track of the assignments and events collectively.

**How do we do that?**

1. Clear simple landing page

2. Easy access to assignments, classes, events and materials

3. Being able to easily find and match with people compfortable with helping in the areas that you need help in.

4. Help each other identify comforts and struggles.

## Ideas

* Ability to archive homework and class data once cohort is complete.

* Ticket system to coordinate between those who want to give help and those who need help.

* Twitch streams to docuemnts our journey. 

* ADHD stream where you're coding web-apps that would help people in the cohort.

* Incorporating adhd and coding together.

* A way to timestamp and make a quick note during vods or live twitch.

* Anki card share?

* A page dedicated to projects that help people in the 100devs cohort.
