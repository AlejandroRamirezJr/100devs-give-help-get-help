# 100Devs-ADHD-Mutualism

## Project Overview

**Goal:** As members of a study group with ADHD, we are making a website application to help each other and make our lives more manageable. We seek to optimize our ability to learn, coordinate, and track assignments and events collectively.

**Steps:**

1. Create a minimalistic landing page.

2. Create the ability to log in to the website and create an account.

2. Develop easy access to assignments, classes, events, and resources.

3. Develop a feature that matches those who have signed up to help with those who have requested help.

4. Help each other identify comforts and struggles.

## Ideas

This list will need prioritization in the future.

* Ability to archive homework and class data once cohort is complete.

* Ticket system to coordinate between those who want to give help and those who need help.

* Twitch streams to documents our journey. 

* ADHD stream where you're coding web-apps that would help people in the cohort.

* Incorporating adhd and coding together.

* A way to timestamp and make a quick note during vods or live twitch.

* Anki card share?

* A page dedicated to projects that help people in the 100devs cohort.
