1. **Introductions & Ice Breaker** | *~15 minutes*
2. **Review Project Scope & Guidelines**| *~15 minutes* 
3. **Core Project Presentation** | *~20 minutes*
4. **Brief Q&A** | *~10 minutes*
5. **Break** | *~5 minutes*
6. **Dividing up into teams** | *~15 minutes*

     This is completely voluntary but will be discussed collectively. Everyone is allowed to wear multiple hats. Teams will operate in an egalitarian format, but there will be a project management team to maintain optimal communication and workflow.

    * Assign Front-end Team

    * Assign Full-stack Team

    * Assign Back-end Team

    * Assign Project-Management Team

7. **Discussion about UX & data structures for each system.** | *~45 minutes*

    During this portion of the meeting, if there are ideas brought up that don’t match the current scope of the project, we’ll park it in the parking lot (we’ll explain). Whatever we don’t get to in 55 minutes, we’ll pick up during the next meeting.
    
    At least 15 minutes needs to be dedicated to the front page because it will set the tone for the entire project and link all of the different systems together. The front page is where we’ll all start to get our feet wet.


8. **Summary & Wrap up** | *~5 minutes*
